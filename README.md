# Surf Shop Analysis

## Overview of Project

The intent of this project was to study temperature trends before opening a surf shop in Oahu. There was two months of the year that were utilized for the study - June and December. The patterns in these two months was studied in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Resources

* Software: Python 3.6.8, Jupyter Notebook 6.0.0, Pandas Library 0.24.2, SQLAlchemy

## Results of Temperature Analysis


### June vs. December Temperature Patterns

June Temperature (2010-17) |  December Temperature (2010-16)

* In June the data observed was for 1,700 data points in June from 2010-17 vs. in the December data there was 1,517 data points from 2010-16
* The average temperature is 74.9F in June compared to 71.9 in December not a huge difference between the two points in the year
* In June the min temperature was 64F and the max temperatoure was 85F, compared to December where the min temperature was 56F and the max was 83F, again not big difference between the dates, meaning the weather and temperature is fairly stable throughout the year.

## Surf Shop Summary

Overall the results are very optimistic and favourable to open a surf and ice cream shop. From the analysis it was show that the weather does not vary greatly between June and December and the minimum temperature never gets too cold that would not make it possible to go surf or want to eat an ice cream. There should be a strong comfort level that this is a solid business proposal to invest in.

Two additional queries I would like to perform would be the following:

1. Query historical data for all months of the year or at least for two more months of the year, i.e. September and March to provide better clarity into the year round weather patterns and have more comfort that the shop can be open and busy throughout the year.
2. Query additional historical data and more recent data. I would like to compare the last 5 years temperature patterns with the prior 5 years to understand if the weather is getting hotter, colder or staying the same. Additionally, if we can acquire more historical data we can understand if there are more varied weather patterns that we may need to account for.
